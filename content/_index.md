# welcome to my page ✨

I'm a **full-stack** and **DevOps engineer** with **12+** years of experience. I've worked in fortune 500, early-stage startups, and higher education. I made my start working in EdTech, but presently focus on digital humanities projects.

Eventually I'll have something more interesting to say.

## this site
I miss boring, static pages. This 'blog' runs on Go using the Hugo Bear theme, but I've built web applications with hundreds of thousands of DAUs.
